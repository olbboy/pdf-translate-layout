## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-04

First public release. Validated end-to-end on a real 15-page technical manual
(263 regions, 173 translated, all 7 quality gates passing).

### Added

- Eight-stage pipeline: preflight → extract/group → translate-prep → agent
  translation → validate → fit/paint → QA gates → human approval.
- Semantic-region layout graph with table cells (`find_tables`), heading /
  list / caption / diagram-label / header-footer classification, two-column
  reading order, label-cluster splitting by x-position, cross-page
  continuation linking, and stable region IDs (fingerprint + quantized
  geometry anchor).
- Typed protected tokens (`URL`, `EMAIL`, `BRAND`, `STD`, `MEAS`, `MODEL`)
  with 1:1 round-trip validation; NFC normalization and a versioned
  full-width punctuation allowlist.
- Constraint-based fitter: binary-search font sizing with 85% hard floor /
  95% review threshold, word-boundary wrapping, explicit `\n` hard breaks,
  alignment preservation, per-codepoint font fallback with sub-run splitting.
- Safe painting: text-only redaction with no-fill masks that never intersect
  kept text, small-glyph-heights mode, link restoration, native font
  subsetting, optimized save.
- Seven quality gates, including keep-region survival checks, tofu/NFC
  verification, geometry & collision checks, image/vector preservation with
  visible-area pixel proof (digest + geometric tolerance, tile-based
  meaningful-difference criterion), 300/600 DPI visual diff with mask
  exclusion, and structural validation.
- Fail-closed job state machine with append-only reviewer audit trail;
  `approve.py --waive CODE=REASON` for reviewer-approved P1 findings
  (P0 findings can never be waived).
- Bundled Noto Sans/Serif/Mono pack (10 static faces, SHA-256 pinned,
  full Vietnamese coverage verified including stacked diacritics).
- Pure-function self-test suite (`selftest.py`).
